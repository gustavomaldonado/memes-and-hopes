Practice your git skills solving the following exercises. Create a file called answers.txt to write the answers.


1. Install git in your computer.
    In Mac you can install, executing the command $ git in your Terminal. If git is not installed,
    it should appears a dialog with the install option. Or you can download and install from here.
  done.

2. Create a GitHub account.
  done.

3. Configure your computer with your account credentials.
    Setting user.name and user.email are the minimum configuration options that need to be set so your name and email
    will show up in your commit messages. Run:
      $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      $ git config --global user.email your@email.com
   done.

4. In your terminal, place in a convenient working directory and create a folder called memes-and-hopes.
   set.

5. Add some good memes to the folder.
   ready.
6. Change to the memes-and-hopes folder and execute the command: $ git status. What is the output?
    MBP-de-Gustavo:memes-and-hopes GustavoM$ git status
    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    	../.DS_Store
    	./
    	../net-canvas-master/
    	../terminal-assignment-gustavomaldonado/

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

7. Initialize the folder as a git repository with the command: $ git init.
   Initialized.

8. Execute again: $ git status. What is the difference with the output of point 6?
    MBP-de-Gustavo:memes-and-hopes GustavoM$ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/GustavoM/github/memes-and-hopes/.git/
    MBP-de-Gustavo:memes-and-hopes GustavoM$ git status
    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    :::::Now it shows all my images as a list the way ls would do plus the .DS_store mac file.

9. Stage the first commit, adding all of your memes.
   git add . does a pretty good job adding the batch.

    done.

12. Link your local repository, with the remote run the command: $git remote add origin
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/memes-and-hopes.git.
    sweet.

13. Now push your first commit with the command: $ git push -u origin master. The -u option only is necessary for the first commit.
    -u option is useful.

14. Visit the page of the remote repository (should be something like "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/memes-and-hopes").
 What do you see?
    A shtupid .DS_Store file and a list of good memes.
